# mood

A new mood diary/calendar productivity project.

## Getting Started

# To navigate to the snackbar and local database portion:
At the home page click the top left and press the "mood test form / snackbar" nav item
Then choose between adding, editing (after you create a mood) or delete

This page is used to implement the basics of CRUD that will be used for the next phase when I integrate the mood forms with the calendar.

Read is integrated with Create/Insert, Update, Delete.

A snackbar will appear for each CRUD, color and text changing depending on if you performed CRUD or pressed the backarrow on the top left.
